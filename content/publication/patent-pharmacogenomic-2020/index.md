abstract: "Methods for identifying patients diagnosed with treatment resistant or refractory depression, pain or other clinical indications who are eligible to receive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, glycine receptor beta (GLRB) modulator, or Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR)-based therapies to include determining the appropriate medication, an optimal dose for each patient, and determining which patients are not eligible to receive the therapy. The pharmacogenomic clinical decision support assays include targeted single nucleotide polymorphisms and clinical values or a combination of targeted single nucleotide polymorphisms, targeted ketamine-specific expansion and contraction of topologically associated domains, and clinical values. The methods described herein allow for a more effective determination of which patients will experience drug efficacy and which patients will experience adverse drug events. The methods provide personalized patient recommendations for dose, the frequency of medication administration, and recommendations on drug choice."
