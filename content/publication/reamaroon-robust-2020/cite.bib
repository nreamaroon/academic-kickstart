 abstract = {This study outlines an image processing algorithm for accurate and consistent lung segmentation in chest radiographs of critically ill adults and children typically obscured by medical equipment. In particular, this work focuses on applications in analysis of acute respiratory distress syndrome â€“ a critical illness with a mortality rate of 40% that affects 200,000 patients in the United States and 3 million globally each year.},
