Iâ€™m a PhD student in the Department of Computational Medicine & Bioinformatics at the University of Michigan, where I'm fortunate to be advised by Professors [Kavan Najarian](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/dcmb/kayvan-najarian-phd) and [Brian Athey](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/dcmb/brian-d-athey-phd). My research focuses on learning using privileged information and transfer learning, with applications to early disease detection and continous health monitoring. I aim to develop theoretically-motivated, principled algorithms for clinical decision support systems. In addition, my interests include label uncertainty, neural networks, reinforcement learning, and applications of machine learning to healthcare. Outside of research, my other goals include positively impacting people's lives through mentorship and education outreach.
