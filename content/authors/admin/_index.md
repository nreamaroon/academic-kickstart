Iâ€™m a PhD student in the Department of Computational Medicine & Bioinformatics at the University of Michigan, where I'm fortunate to be advised by Professors [Kavan Najarian](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/dcmb/kayvan-najarian-phd) and [Brian Athey](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/dcmb/brian-d-athey-phd) at the [Biomedical & Clinical Informatics Lab](http://najarianlab.ccmb.med.umich.edu). 

My research tackles long-standing problems in machine learning and health research, such as label uncertainty (e.g. from ambiguity in diagnosis or poorly labeled examples) and representation of data that may not be reliably available. I aim to develop theoretically-motivated, principled algorithms to solve these problems by drawing from reinforcement learning, computer vision, and structured learning approaches. I'm currently applying these techniques to early disease detection (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and continuous health monitoring. Outside of research, my other goals include positively impacting people's lives through mentorship and education outreach.
