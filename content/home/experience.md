  Conducted research under the guidance of Dr. Kayvan Najarian on applications of machine learning in healthcare and medicine. Develop theoretically-motivated, principled algorithms to solve problems such as label uncertainty and representation of unreliable data by drawing from reinforcement learning, computer vision, causal inference, and other structured learning approaches.

  Projets include:
  
  * Learning Using Privileged Information (LUPI) in reinforcement learning, XGBoost, and SVM to utilize knowledge/data accessible only during model training but not available during testing/deployment. Designed a retrospective-prospective study to validate, test, and deploy trained machine learning models on data from Michigan Medicine (with IRB approval).

  * Transfer learning w/ convolutional neural networks and deep residual networks for predictive modeling and detection of critical illness from chest x-rays and CT scans. Implemented and trained deep learning models with scalable architecture using TensorFlow and Keras. 

  * Feature engineering and development of novel feature extraction techniques (e.g. Directional Blur) to capture diffuse lung opacities as a mathematical concept for detection of acute respiratory distress syndrome.

  * Accounting for label uncertainty from ambiguity in medical diagnosis. Developed robust methods to incorporate diagnostic uncertainty into Support Vector Machines for clinical decision making. Developed and optimized algorithms as part of a multi-disciplinary collaboration between research engineers in our lab and physicians at Michigan Medicine. 

  * Lung segmentation on complex chest x-ray scans of hospitalized, critically ill patients with severe lung pathology (e.g. acute hypoxic respiratory failure, ARDS) at Michigan Medicine. Implemented and trained a U-Net based convolutional neural network for lung segmentation and developed a novel method for lung segmentation in conjunction with traditional image process techniques to achieve outstanding results.
